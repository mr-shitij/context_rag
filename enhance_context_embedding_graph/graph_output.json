This systematic literature review aims to identify existing research trends, methodologies, research gaps and propose a generalized framework for streamlining the road route optimization process. The review addresses three key research questions: RQ-1. The application of deep learning for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, RQ-2. The use of MCDM techniques in road route alignment and RQ-3. Techniques for optimizing road route alignment.

The proposed generalized framework outlines a systematic approach encompassing problem definition, criteria selection, data preparation, deep learning-based LULC classification, MCDM and Least Cost Path analysis. This SLR contributes to the development of efficient, sustainable and equitable road route optimization strategies for better infrastructure planning and worldwide development. There is scope for integrating emerging technologies, enhancing MCDM approaches, promoting cross-disciplinary collaboration, addressing data availability and quality, conducting case studies, emphasizing sustainability, resilience and focusing on global and regional contexts.\n\nIndex Terms\u2014Road Route Alignment and Optimization, Land Use Land Cover (LULC) Classification, Deep Learning (DL), Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), and AI Searching Techniques.\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nGEOGRAPHIC Information System (GIS) has become an essential tool in modern geoinformatics and geo-planning. Their integration with advanced technologies like AI and deep learning is revolutionizing how we approach complex challenges such as road alignment and linear infrastructure development. Traditionally, road construction relied heavily on manual surveys and measurements. This approach, while effective in its time, often neglected critical factors such as environmental, economic, engineering and social considerations.\n\nShitij Agrawal, Sanskar Jamadar and Suraj Sawant are with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, COEP Technological University, Pune (411005), Maharashtra, India (e-mail: agrawalss21.comp@coeptech.ac.in; jamadarsr21.comp@coeptech.ac.in; sts.comp@coeptech.ac.in).\n\nRahul Dev Garg is with the Civil Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee, Uttrakhand, India (e-mail: rdgarg@ce.iitr.ac.in).\n\nIn today\u2019s world, where road networks are continuously expanding to support growth and meet sustainable development goals, there\u2019s an increasing need for AI-driven road route optimization. This approach leverages the power of GIS combined with the analytical capabilities of deep learning to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of road development projects.\n\nRoads are the backbone of transportation infrastructure, playing a vital role in connecting communities, facilitating trade, and driving economic growth (1). Recognizing the importance of roads, governments worldwide invest heavily in road construction and maintenance (2). In the United States, the Biden administration has put forward a proposal for a $2 trillion infrastructure initiative aimed at considerable enhancements to the nation\u2019s infrastructure, including major investments in roads, bridges, and highways (3). Similarly, India has ambitious plans to expand its road network, with the government aiming to construct 65,000 km of national highways by 2022. This project is expected to incur a cost of Rs. 5.35 lakh crore (approximately US$ 741.51 billion) (4). These investments not only improve connectivity and reduce travel times but also create employment opportunities (5). However, the development of road infrastructure must also consider sustainability and environmental concerns, such as greenhouse gas emissions and habitat loss (6).\n\nFailure to integrate GIS with deep learning in this domain can lead to persistent delays, inefficiency, violations of pre-set constraints and suboptimal routing decisions. Given the high demand for sustainable road development, addressing these challenges is more urgent than ever.\n\nMoreover, the methodologies and frameworks developed for optimizing road routes using GIS and deep learning can be applied to other linear engineering problems such as railway route alignment, selection for oil and gas pipelines, metro route selection, and evacuation route selection. This review aims to develop a comprehensive framework for road route optimization, leveraging the combined strengths of GIS, deep learning and optimization to address the complex demands of modern infrastructure development. This approach is not only about improving road construction but is also a step towards more intelligent, efficient and sustainable infrastructure planning and development. The 2023 study by F. Jiang et al. presents a comprehensive framework for sustainable urban road alignment planning, focusing on the identification and evaluation of key factors (7). This study categorizes factors into demands such as traffic and local development and constraints including environmental, engineering, cost and social aspects. The framework employs\n# IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\ndigital tools and spatial analysis methods like GIS, digital image processing and digital twin technology to cohesively format these factors for effective planning. Experts use Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods to assess the importance of each factor. Furthermore, the study introduces a least-cost wide path analysis for road alignment which considers road width and accommodates both new road construction and the expansion of existing roads.\n\nIn a related domain, the 2023 review paper by Fei Li et al. proposes integrating remote sensing with machine learning techniques to enhance urban sustainability (8). This integration aims to make urban sustainability more explicable and efficient. While the literature review by F. Jiang et al. contributes significantly to the field, it also opens avenues for future research, particularly in integrating AI technologies like deep learning and further exploring MCDM techniques (7). Similarly, the work of Fei Li et al. highlights the potential of combining machine learning with remote sensing to address urban sustainability challenges (8).\n\nThe existing literature on route alignment primarily discusses various factors involved in developing new routes and the methodologies for route selection. However, with the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, especially in deep learning, there emerges a need to explore the role of deep learning in route alignment. Additionally, while Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques play a crucial role in the road route alignment process, there is a noticeable lack of comprehensive literature analyzing MCDM techniques specifically for road route alignment. This situation highlights a significant research gap that needs to be filled, underscoring the importance of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR).\n\nThis review stands out by uniquely integrating road route alignment with deep learning techniques and analyzing Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, complemented by the latest research trends. This approach distinguishes it from other studies in road route planning.\n\nThis research revolves around three pivotal research questions, enhanced by insights from a systematic review employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology (9).\n\nFirstly, the research investigates how deep learning, a type of advanced technology in artificial intelligence, is used to study Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Classification. Deep learning is good at understanding complex data and it can be helpful in identifying different types of land and how they are used.\n\nSecondly, it looks at Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques. MCDM helps in making good decisions about where to place roads by considering many different factors. This study explores how MCDM is used in practice.\n\nFinally, the SLR examines techniques for optimizing road route alignment. Through the exploration of these three areas, the research seeks to offer comprehensive and current insight into the planning of road routes and the examination of land use in an intelligent and well-informed manner. This SLR includes insights from general observations of paper distributions, application fields, deep learning and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approaches, along with road route optimization methods.\n\n# METHODOLOGY\n\nThis study sets out to develop a comprehensive framework for the integration of deep learning in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) analysis for optimizing road route alignment, utilizing Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques. This framework aims to enhance road route alignment projects by promoting sustainability. To achieve this, a systematic literature review was performed using the PRISMA method, a well-acknowledged approach for structuring systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This systematic review enables an in-depth and broad understanding of the current research that merges deep learning with LULC and examines MCDM and road route optimization techniques. It identifies the existing state of knowledge, the methods employed and the potential research gaps that could be filled in future studies. The application of the PRISMA method guarantees that the review process is both reproducible and transparent, thereby reinforcing the study\u2019s reliability and facilitating the verification and future update of its conclusions with new findings. The visual representation of the PRISMA Methodology is depicted in Fig. 1. The review process was structured into three stages: planning, conducting the review and reporting the findings.\n\n|Google Scholar|Science Direct|IEEE Explore|\n|---|---|---|\n|Records Identified n = 370|Records After Duplicate Removed n = 353|Duplicate Records n = 17|\n|Records Screened by Applying Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria n = 353|Records Excluded n = 237| |\n|Full Text Articles Assessed For Eligibility n = 133|Full Text Articles Excluded Due To Out Of Scope n = 1| |\n|Studies Included In Qualitative Synthesis n = 157|Snowball Sampling n = 25| |\n\nFig. 1. PRISMA Diagram\n\nTo ensure that the review would offer valuable insights into the present opportunities and challenges, the planning phase included the definition of the research question, objectives, as well as the criteria for what would be included and excluded. The academic search engine provided by COEP Technological\n# IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\nUniversity Pune which offers access to various databases including Google Scholar, Science Direct and IEEE Xplore was utilized to gather related publications. The selection of IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar and Science Direct as primary search platforms was strategic due to their extensive access to a multitude of databases, facilitating comprehensive searches across diverse resources such as conference papers, journal articles, books, and more. A search query was executed on November 8, 2023. This systematic literature review (SLR) did not restrict the publication date in the search criteria to encompass as broad a range of relevant literature as possible. For this SLR, 3 research questions were formulated and specific search queries corresponding to these research questions were developed with the details provided in Table I, queries were deployed for keyword-based searches, ensuring precision in data retrieval.\n\n# TABLE I\n\n# REPHRASED RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOR THE SLR\n\n|No.|Research Questions (RQ)|Queries|\n|---|---|---|\n|1|Which techniques employ deep learning for the optimization of road routes?|(Road Route Optimization using GIS with deep learning) OR (LULC Classification using deep learning)|\n|2|What studies have applied Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques to optimize road routes?|Road Route Optimization using MCDM Techniques (Multi-Criteria Decision Making)|\n|3|What literature exists on the alignment and optimization of road routes using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)?|(Road Route Optimization using GIS) OR (Road Route Alignment using GIS) OR (Road Route Selection using GIS)|\n\nThe field of research focusing on optimizing road routes using deep learning and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques is still developing. This makes it difficult to locate studies that perfectly align with this specific topic. The initial results of our search as outlined in Table I, are summarized in Table II. These initial findings are considered preliminary; they consist of raw data collected before applying any criteria for including or excluding studies.\n\n# TABLE II\n\n# THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH QUERIES IN DIFFERENT DATABASES\n\n|No.|Research Question (RQ)|IEEE Explore|Science Direct|Google Scholar|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|1|RQ.1|37|1603|41700|\n|2|RQ.2|0|698|19,600|\n|3|RQ.3|37|13,802|3,12,700|\n\nDuring our search in these databases, we refined the results by examining the titles and keywords to select those most relevant to our study. Additionally, we filtered the search results based on the type of content, such as books, book chapters, conference papers and research articles. We only selected research articles, conference papers and journal papers resulting in a total of 370 records.\n\nDuring the review phase, the initial step consisted of examining the abstracts of the collected literature and applying predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. From the initial corpus of 370 records, this process resulted in the identification of 133 primary records. It was noted that among these, 17 records were duplicates.\n\nSubsequently, an exhaustive examination of the full texts of these 133 literatures was undertaken, adhering to the inclusion and exclusion criteria to further refine the selection. This process resulted in the identification of 132 literatures suitable for the primary study.\n\nTo augment the scope of relevant literature, the backward snowballing technique was employed on the selected 132 studies. This method involves reviewing the references within the primary studies to identify additional relevant works. Through this technique, 25 more studies were discovered, culminating in a total of 157 primary studies for comprehensive analysis.\n\nThe 157 selected studies were carefully analyzed and reviewed, focusing on five key aspects: a) Approach b) Dataset c) Limitations d) Advantages e) Accuracy f) Criteria Considered. In the final phase of reporting, a systematic review of these 157 studies was presented. This comprehensive analysis aimed to provide a clear overview of the current state of research in the field, identifying trends, gaps and presenting a framework for optimizing road route alignment through the application of deep learning.\n\n# TABLE III\n\n# INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA\n\n|Inclusion Criteria|Exclusion Criteria|\n|---|---|\n|Research Literature should be in English|Non-peer reviewed articles and non-English studies.|\n|Full Access through Institute|Studies lacking methodological details for reproducibility.|\n|Studies that use GIS for route optimization|Studies on routing protocols which does not fall in the category of linear engineering structure or do not use DL with GIS|\n|Studies that optimise algorithms for various transportation modes|Studies limited to individual vehicle route planning.|\n|Studies that compare route selection methodologies|Studies focused solely on traffic assignment.|\n|Studies that analyse alignment alternatives for new transportation corridors|Studies limited to non-novel modelling/simulation.|\n|Papers that discuss the route alignment criteria/factors| |\n|Studies that assess computational efficiency for route optimization / DL in GIS [computational speed and resource utilization]| |\n|Studies that used Deep Learning for LULC| |\n\n# III.

General Observations\n\nAll 157 research articles were categorized by country-wise distribution and it was found that the majority of the articles originated from India (24.06%), followed by China (15.04%), Turkey (4.51%) and the USA (3.01%). The country-wise publication distribution is visually represented in the word cloud shown in Fig. 2.\n\nThe research articles are classified into 3 groups according to the research questions to get a detailed understanding of\n# IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\n# Fig. 2.

MCDM Techniques Year Wise Publication\n\nIt can be seen that there is an increase in publications from the year 2013 till 2021, from 2021 there is a decline in new publications and in 2023 there are no articles related to MCDM Techniques in the domain of route optimization specifically.\n\n# Fig. 5. LULC Using Deep Learning Year Wise Publication\n\nIt can be observed that there is an increase in the number of publications in 2023 as compared to previous years. This shows the trend in the field and growth is expected to continue in 2024.\n\n# Generalized Framework\n\nThis study aims to provide a base to guide further studies regarding road route planning and optimization through the application of deep learning and MCDM techniques. This section aims to give an overview of the process, further sections describe individual components of the process in detail. This involves a threefold approach:\n\n1. Defining the endpoints and the problem at hand, specifically focusing on the source and destination between which the road needs to be built.\n2. Identifying the criteria to consider such as environmental, social, economic and engineering factors which are crucial in road construction. These criteria may vary based on the study\u2019s nature and should be referenced from existing literature.\n3. Preparing and collecting the dataset relevant to the defined criteria, which may involve downloading geospatial datasets for the area under consideration. The dataset should include classes related to the defined criteria to create an overlay map.\n4. Preprocessing the data to ensure consistency in format and resolution and to eliminate issues such as clouds and shadows for better classification. This involves converting vector data to raster format for ease of processing, considering that raster data structures allow for a more analytical approach in continuous space study, despite their disadvantages in accuracy and data storage.\n5. Performing LULC classification using various deep learning techniques for image segmentation. The classes used for segmentation depend on the initially defined criteria.\n6. Identifying and assigning ranks to the criteria, which could be derived from literature or determined by field experts. These ranks are crucial for the application of the algorithms to derive optimal alignments.\n# IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\n# MCDM techniques.\n\n1. Applying MCDM techniques to identify the weights of the criteria based on the ranks provided by the field experts. These weights are crucial for the subsequent steps of the framework.\n2. Apply the assigned weights to the raster data, creating a weighted raster that represents all the criteria. This step combines the LULC classification results with the criteria weights, preparing the data for the least cost path analysis (LCPA).\n3. Perform least cost path analysis (LCPA) on the weighted raster to find the optimal route between source and destination.\n4. Generate multiple candidate routes by varying the criteria weights in the LCPA step. This will provide a set of potential routes that optimize different aspects of the problem.\n5. Apply MCDM techniques to evaluate routes based on the predefined criteria. This step provides a comprehensive evaluation of the generated routes from multiple perspectives.\n6. Conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the MCDM results by varying the criteria weights and observing how the rankings of the candidate routes change. If the rankings remain relatively stable, it indicates that the results are robust and less sensitive to changes in the criteria weights.\n7. Select the final optimal route based on the MCDM rankings and sensitivity analysis results. The route that consistently performs well and is less sensitive to changes in criteria weights can be considered the most suitable choice.\n\nThroughout this structured approach, the importance of maintaining data consistency in terms of format and resolution is emphasized to ease the processing steps, as highlighted in Fig. 6 depicting the raster and vector data formats.\n\nAlso, overlaying different map layers to normalize values into a single raster is essential, as illustrated in the process and Fig. 7, ensuring that multiple routes can be generated and evaluated by assigning different weights to criteria, enabling the selection of the best possible route according to specific project requirements and criteria.\n\n# C. Sustainability Criteria\n\nSustainable practices in road construction are crucial for balancing environmental protection, economic efficiency, and societal well-being. Prioritizing construction on stable, less ecologically sensitive lands minimizes environmental impacts such as erosion and habitat disruption, aligning with sustainability goals to preserve natural resources and support community health.\n\nStudy provides a comprehensive list of criteria that can be considered during road development including traffic factors, economical factors, engineering factors, environmental factors and social factors; interested readers are encouraged to consult it for more information.\n\n# Fig. 7. Overlay Map\n\n# D. Land Use Land Cover Classification (LULC)\n\nLand Use (LU) and Land Cover (LC) are critical components for understanding the spatial variations and the impacts of human activities on Earth\u2019s surface. Land Cover refers to the natural state of the Earth\u2019s surface, encompassing elements like soil, water, and vegetation. In contrast, Land Use denotes the alterations made to the land through human actions, such as deforestation, urbanization, and the development of built-up areas, along with natural phenomena like droughts and floods.\n\nThe study and classification of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes are vital for remote sensing, providing valu-\n# IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\nable insights through the extraction, processing, and classification of spectral signatures. Over recent decades, significant efforts have been directed towards automating LULC classification, a task that has become increasingly feasible due to advancements in remote sensing technologies. These advancements enable the analysis of large datasets, facilitating image classification, processing, and predictions of future changes (21; 22).\n\n# Deep Learning Papers\n\n# Machine Learning Papers\n\n|2015|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|14|8|2| | | | | | |\n\nFig. 8. LULC Techniques Year-Wise Count\n\nAs the volume of data and the complexity of its analysis have grown, the machine learning (ML) community has explored various algorithms for image classification within LULC. Yet, the burgeoning data and the advent of new technologies and datasets have introduced classification challenges that transcend the capabilities of conventional machine-learning approaches. In this context, the availability of a wide array of socioeconomic data provides essential information for urban development planning and analysis (21; 22). The research shows that Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) data is mainly used in urban areas, as indicated by Fig. 9, which shows the domain-wise count of the paper.\n\n# Deep Learning (DL)\n\nhas emerged as a powerful tool capable of addressing these challenges. Unlike traditional algorithms, deep learning algorithms excel in processing large-scale data, identifying intricate patterns, and uncovering regularities. This ability significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of LULC classification, making deep learning a pivotal technology in the field (21; 23).\n\n|Road Extraction|Transportation Safety|Highway Alignment|Rural Road Network|Digital Planning|Cultural Heritage Detection|Road Data Surveying|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|7|Railway Alignment Optimization|Terrain Feature Extraction|Road Vectorization|Emergency Routing Systems|Urban Landscape Research|Urban LULC Classification|\n|Crop Type Derivation|Crop Identification|LULC Identification|Vembanad Lake System|Land-use Patterns (Mining)| |Paper Count|\n\nFig. 9.

The quality of data is important for better accuracy (25). In pre-processing the input data is prepared for reducing its dimensionality, clipping raster images, image re-sampling, buffering and geo-referencing, denoise, synchronising, eliminating irrelevant information from the data, fusion of data (22), study (26) states that atmosphere is the primary source of noise for the accurate measurement also it talks about the algorithms used to remove atmospheric noise from the data.

(41) developed LoopNet, an advanced deep learning algorithm for land use classification using Landsat 8 imagery, achieving up to 90.46% accuracy with the help of generative adversarial networks. Manuel Carranza-Garc\u00eda et al. (29) highlighted the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in classifying LULC with superior accuracy over SVM and random forests. Shivam Pande et al. (43) unveiled a hybrid model blending 3D and 2D CNN layers for multimodal remote sensing image analysis. Munazza Usmani et al. (44) integrated OpenStreetMap\u2019s information with remote sensing data for global-scale segmentation, achieving high accuracies in urban feature analysis. These studies collectively showcase the evolution of LULC classification methodologies, emphasizing the potential of integrating diverse data sources and deep learning techniques for environmental monitoring and urban planning.\n\n# The following are the most widely used deep learning techniques for LULC classification:\n\n1. # Stacked Autoencoder (SAEs)\n\nAn Autoencoder (AE) is recognized as the fundamental component of a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE). An AE consists of a visible layer with i inputs, a hidden layer with N units, and a reconstruction layer with i units. The training process encompasses two phases:\n\n1. Encoding: Mapping input x \u2208 Ri to hidden representation h \u2208 RN.\n2. Decoding: Mapping hidden representation h back to reconstruction y \u2208 Ri.\n\nThe encoding and decoding processes are mathematically expressed as equation 1 and 2.\n\nh = f (whx + bh) , (1)\n\ny = f (wy x + by ) , (2)\n\nwhere wh denote the weights from input to hidden layer and wy from hidden to output layer respectively, bh and by are the biases.\n# IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\nbiases, and f (\u00b7) is an activation function. The estimation of the reconstruction error is achieved by minimizing the squared Euclidean distance, \u2225x \u2212 y\u222522.\n\n# SAEs\n\nSAEs are built by stacking multiple AEs in a way that the output of one layer serves as the input of the next. This architecture allows for the use of SAEs as spectral classifiers.\n\n|Encoder|Decoder|\n|---|---|\n|h(x)| |\n\nVisible Units\n\nHidden Units\n\nFig. 13. Deep Belief Network\n\nyj = \u2211i=1d f (xi \u2217 wj + bj)\n\nwhere f (\u00b7) is an activation function, e.g., ReLU defined as \u03c3(x) = max(0, x).\n\n# 2) Deep Belief Network (DBNs)\n\nDBN (46) has shown strong capability for unsupervised feature learning within the computer vision domain. A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a layer-wise training model essential to the Deep Belief Network (DBN) architecture. An RBM comprises a network with visible units v = {0, 1}d and hidden units h = {0, 1}L. The energy of a joint configuration (v, h) is given by equation 3:\n\nE(v, h; \u03b8) = \u2212\u2211i=1d bivi \u2212 \u2211j=1L ajhj \u2212 \u2211i=1d \u2211j=1L wijvihj\n\n= \u2212bTv \u2212 aTh \u2212 vTw h,\n\nwhere \u03b8 = {b, aj, wij} includes the biases bi and aj for visible and hidden units respectively, and wij represents the weight between them.\n\nDBNs are formed by stacking RBMs to enhance feature representation. The final layer can be a logistic regression layer, making DBNs suitable for classification tasks.\n\n# 3) Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs)\n\nCNNs are inspired by the visual system and utilize local connections to capture 2-D spatial features. They consist of convolution layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers. The key components are:\n\n1. Convolutional Layers: Input is convolved with filters to produce feature maps. For input X and filter j, the output is:\n\n# 4) Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs)\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (47) process sequences by maintaining a hidden state that captures temporal information. The hidden state ht at time t is updated as:\n\nht = {0\n\nht = f1(ht\u22121, xt) if t = 0, otherwise,\n# IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\n# 9\n\nwith w and u being the weight matrices for the current input and previous state respectively, and f1 a nonlinear function.\n\nInput\nHidden Layer 1\nHidden Layer 2\nOutput\n\nassessment of various factors(49). The utilization of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques has become a cornerstone in this context, offering a way to handle multiple criteria simultaneously, thereby guiding decision-makers towards the most advantageous decision alternatives(50). Fig. 17 shows the application domain in which MCDM techniques are used according to the literature and it shows that the transportation sector is the one where MCDM techniques are mostly used.\n\n# Highway Alignment\n\n# Highway Tunnel Doors\n\n# Forest Road Routes\n\n# Evaluation Of Alternative Monorail Routes\n\n# Safe Route Planner\n\n# Landfill Site Selection\n\n# 5) Generative Adversarial Network (GANs):\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (48) consist of a generator G creating fake inputs and a discriminator D distinguishing between real and fake inputs. The training aims to solve equation 6:\n\n|minmaxV (D, G) = Ex\u223cp(x)[log(D(x))]|G|D|\n|---|---|---|\n|+ Ez\u223cp(z)[log(1 \u2212 D(G(z)))]| | |\n\nGANs have been adapted for tasks like classification by incorporating auxiliary classifiers to enable multi-class label prediction.\n\nMulti-criteria analysis has gained widespread adoption in transport project studies, especially those commissioned by public bodies, and is a prevalent tool in assessing EU-funded research projects(51). This methodology\u2019s application ranges from selecting railway routes, as demonstrated by Ali A. Darvishsefat et al. in their proposal of a railway route between Rasht and Anzali(52), to evaluating road alignments through the integration of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and GIS technologies by researchers like Tae-Ho, Roh et al.(53).\n\nVarious studies illustrate the multifaceted approach to infrastructure planning using GIS and MCDM techniques. For instance, Mario De Luca et al. conducted a multi-criteria analysis in a GIS environment to identify preferential corridors for a high-speed line in Italy(54), while S.Loganathan et al. optimized highway alignment using GIS and soft computing tools, underscoring the potential for enhancing route selection and environmental conservation(55). Similarly, Hala A. Effat et al. employed MCDM techniques to design and assess highway route alternatives in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, integrating environmental and economic factors(56).\n\n# E. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)\n\nThe complexity and challenges of selecting a suitable route alignment for roadways and highways are significant, as this task involves balancing a wide array of criteria\u2014some of which may complement each other, while others may compete. This decision-making process is crucial in determining the final alignment of a highway, relying on a comprehensive effectiveness of GIS and MCDM approaches extends to select-\n# IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\n# 10\n\nIntegrating GIS with AHP has proven to be an efficient and cost-effective method for road alignment selection, as shown in studies by Aminuddeen Sanusi et al. and others, which advocate for the wider adoption of these technologies to improve accuracy and sustainability in route planning.\n\nThe application of these methods in addressing complex infrastructure challenges, such as navigating around natural hazards or optimizing route alignments for environmental and economic benefits, is well-documented across various geographical contexts and project types.\n\nThese examples collectively highlight the dynamic and effective nature of combining GIS and MCDM techniques in infrastructure planning and development. By leveraging such integrated approaches, decision-makers can significantly enhance the efficiency, connectivity, and safety of transportation networks while minimizing environmental impacts and meeting the diverse needs of urban and rural communities.\n\nThe word cloud presented in Fig. 18 illustrates the various MCDM techniques employed in the literature. Some of the commonly used MCDM techniques are described as follows:\n\n|1) Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP):|The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, introduced by Saaty, involves calculating the importance of each criterion using a scale ranging from 1 to 9, where 1 signifies equal importance, 3 moderate importance, 5 strong importance, 7 very strong importance, and 9 represents extreme importance.|\n|---|---|\n|2) TOPSIS:|The TOPSIS method, introduced by Hwang and Yoon, emphasizes the significance of calculating the distance of each alternative from the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution.|\n\nStep 1: The evaluation matrix represents the alternatives and a set of criteria, where (Aij) defines ratings.\n\n| | | | |Criteria 1|Criteria 2|Criteria n|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| | |Alternatives 1| |A11|A12|A1n|\n| | |Alternatives 2| |A21|A22|A2n|\n| | |Alternatives m| |Am1|Am2|Amn|\n\nStep 2: Calculate the normalized values (Rij) using the alternatives m and criteria n by using equation 12:\n\nRij = Aijm / \u03a3 Aij\n\nStep 3: Assign weights to the criteria and calculate the weighted normalized values (Vij) by using equation 13:\n\nVij = Wj \u00b7 Rij\n\nStep 4: Determine the best (s+) and the worst (s\u2212) performance values for each criterion using equation 14:\n\ns+ = max(Vij) for each criterion j,\n\ns\u2212 = min(Vij) for each criterion j.\n\nStep 5: CI calculation requires determining \u03bbmax (the principal eigenvalue) with the equation 10:\n\n\u03bbmax = \u03a3 (aij wj)\n\nStep 6: Consistency Ratio (CR) refers to the total consistency of the AHP calculation. If CR > 0.1, the importance of each criterion must be reconsidered. The formula is given in equation 11:\n\nCR = RICI\n\nwhere RI stands for Random Index, a value according to the matrix order.\n\nFig. 18.

The alternative with the minimum Qj value is considered the best solution.\n\n# Step 6: Calculation of Grey Relational Grade\n\nThe Grey Relational Grade of alternative i is calculated using equation 27:\n\nri = \u2211(\u03b3(n) \u00b7 w(n)) / m\n(27)\n\nwhere w(n) represents the weight of the nth criterion.\n\n# Step 7: Finally, the criteria are ranked according to their Grey Relational Grade.\n\nThe priority ranking is obtained, and the best alternative is selected based on this ranking.\n# IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\n# 5) ELECTRE:\n\nThe ELECTRE (72) methods (I, II, and III) are part of a family of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods that differ primarily in how they handle decision-making criteria and alternatives. While ELECTRE I and II focus on the use of concordance and discordance matrices, ELECTRE III introduces the principle of fuzzy logic, utilizing preference and indifference thresholds to determine concordance and discordance indexes. The steps for The ELECTRE I Method are as follows:\n\n1. Step 1: The criteria are coded on numerical scales with identical ranges to allow for comparison. This step is not always simple and may require a common scale to be constructed. The coding should justify the use of the max operator introduced later to model discordance.\n2. Step 2: For each pair of actions (a, b) in the set A, where a \u2260 b, compute the concordance index using equation 28:\n\nc(aSb) = \u2211{j:g(a)g(b)}j wj\n3. Step 3: For each pair of actions (a, b) in the set A, where a \u2260 b, compute the discordance index using equation 29:\n\nd(aSb) = {j: gj(maxj(b))} {gj(b) \u2212 gj(a)}a < g\n4. Step 4: An action \"a outranks b\" (aSb) if and only if:\n\n1. The concordance index c(aSb) is greater than or equal to a given concordance level s, where s is typically in the range [0.5, 1 \u2212 minj\u2208J wj].\n2. The discordance index d(aSb) is less than or equal to a given discordance level v.\n5. Step 5: Exploitation of the outranking relation, Identify a subset of actions (kernel) from which the decision-maker can select the final action. Actions outside the kernel are outranked by at least one action in the kernel. If the graph contains no direct cycles, there exists a single kernel forming a partition on A. If the graph contains direct cycles, a preprocessing step is needed to reduce maximal direct cycles to singleton components, forming a partition on A.\n\n# 6) PROMETHEE:\n\nThe PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations) method is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that was developed by Brans and Vincke (1985) (73). Different versions of PROMETHEE were introduced (Brans & Mareschal, 1991 (74), 1994 (75), 1995 (76)). PROMETHEE evaluates various alternatives based on multiple criteria. It is distinguished by its use of preference functions to translate deviations between alternatives into preference degrees, facilitating a comprehensive and nuanced comparison of alternatives. The steps of the PROMETHEE Method are as follows:\n\n1. Step 1: Determination of Preference Functions, The process begins by determining a specific preference function Pj(a, b) for each criterion j. This function translates the deviation between the evaluations of two alternatives a and b into a preference degree ranging from 0 to 1, based on the equation provided by (77), the equation is as follows:\n\nPj(a, b) = Gj{fj(a) \u2212 fj(b)} (31)\n2. Step 2: Assignment of Weights to Criteria, Relative importance or weights of each criterion are assigned to reflect their significance in the decision-making process.\n3. Step 3: Computation of Overall Preference Index, An overall preference index \u03c0(a, b) is computed by taking into account all criteria. This index is based on the equations:\n\n\u03c0(a, b) = \u2211j Wj Pj(a, b) (32)\n4. Step 4: involves the Calculation of Positive and Negative Preference Flows. The positive preference flow, denoted as \u03c6+(a) measures the extent to which an alternative a is globally preferred over all other alternatives. Conversely, the negative preference flow, \u03c6\u2212(a) assesses the degree to which an alternative a is globally preferred by all other alternatives.\n5. Step 5: involves determining Partial and Complete Rankings. The PROMETHEE I method achieves a partial ranking by intersecting two distinct rankings: the first is created by arranging actions based on their positive flow scores in a descending order, and the second is formed by organizing actions according to their negative flow scores in an ascending order. An optimal action is characterized by having a positive preference flow of 1 and a negative preference flow of 0.\n6. Step 6: Selection of the Best Alternative, The best alternative is selected based on the comprehensive evaluation of positive and negative preference flows, taking into account the relative importance of each criterion.\n# F. Optimum Road Route Generation\n\nThe majority of road generation methods are based on least-cost algorithms (78; 79). Remote sensing along with least cost path analysis (LCPA) is a proven tool for optimal route selection (80). Least-cost path analysis (LCPA) based on shortest path algorithms is usually employed to find optimal road route alignment in the raster data in the GIS environment (Douglas 1994) (81). LCPA provides routes according to the desired parameter-oriented approach (78). LCP algorithm is used to find the least cost between two locations, where the least cost path would be minimum distance or minimum construction cost depending on the user (22; 82). A route of length 53.12 km has been selected which is more than 4.69 km of the existing road but the fastest route between Bonsa and Bogoso using APH and LCPA (80).\n\nA study conducted by W. H. Nadir integrates the GIS-GA (Geographic Information System-Genetic Algorithm) model to locate and configure a corridor-based optimum horizontal highway alignment (83). Manoj K. Jha et al. also utilize GIS, genetic algorithms (GAs) along with visualization techniques to optimize highway development of Maryland on the basis of minimization of highway cost (84). M. Rybansky proposed an approach that combines Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi graphs, and Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm to determine the quickest or shortest paths, considering factors like tree stand structure, vehicle dimensions, and terrain constraints to effectively map out optimal routes for emergency scenarios (85). A study by Manoj K. Jha et al. adapts previous highway optimization strategies for rail transit, utilizing GIS for evaluating costs and environmental impacts (86).\n\nAccording to the research conducted by Ju Young Kang et al., Dijkstra algorithm is more useful when we are dealing with the GIS raster maps as compared to the A* algorithm, as A* cannot guarantee finding the shortest path. Unlike video games or autonomous vehicles, real-time search is not important while optimum solution is a key requirement (81). However, according to research conducted by Marcelo Otone Aguiar et al., D\u2019Esopo-Pape is more efficient than algorithms like Dijkstra, and Bellman-Ford (88).\n\n# Following are some of the most popular cost optimization algorithms according to the literature:\n\n- Algorithm 1 Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm (89)\n\nfunction DIJKSTRA(g, s)\nfor each vertex y in g do\ndist[y] \u2190 \u221e\nprevious[y] \u2190 undefined\nend for\ndist[s] \u2190 0\nN \u2190 the set of all nodes in Graph\nwhile N is not empty do\nx \u2190 node in N with smallest dist[]\nremove x from N\nfor each neighbor y of x do\nalt \u2190 dist[x] + dist between(x, y)\nif alt < dist[y] then\ndist[y] \u2190 alt\nprevious[y] \u2190 x\nend if\nend for\nend while\nreturn previous[]\n\n# Fig. 20.

The research utilizes the PRISMA method which is highly respected for its systematic and structured approach which enhances the credibility and trustworthiness of the review. The use of multiple major databases and the \u2019backward snowballing\u2019 technique increases the chance of finding the most relevant research available. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Clearly defined filters ensure including research that genuinely aligns with research aims, maintaining the focus defined in Table 3.\n\nThe research questions mentioned in Table 1 are crisp, unambiguous and unique which are not being considered in any other research paper and these questions are essential to understand road route optimization, deep learning techniques for LULC and application of MCDM techniques.\n\nThe analysis of publication trends highlights intriguing dynamics within the field of road route alignment optimization research. The steady increase in publications on road route alignment, with a dip in 2022, suggests a maintained interest in this domain. Notably, the growth of publications related to LULC using deep learning in 2023 reveals a promising trajectory for incorporating advanced computational techniques also there is an influence of increasing computational power, making DL more feasible. This surge could be due to the increased accuracy and efficiency that deep learning offers in analyzing complex land cover datasets. Conversely, the decline in articles focused on MCDM techniques from 2020 onwards warrants further investigation. It\u2019s possible that the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s disruptions to fieldwork and data collection may have contributed to this decrease. Additionally, researchers might be re-evaluating MCDM techniques in light of new challenges posed by the pandemic, such as the rise of e-commerce and potential changes in traffic patterns. Alternatively, there could be a shift towards integrating MCDM with deep learning methods or exploring other optimization techniques altogether which are better suited to the increased computational resources now available.\n\nThe higher number of articles originating from India, China, Turkey, and the USA reflects a correlation between infrastructure development priorities and research output. This aligns with the importance of road networks as a core component of transportation systems, which are vital for economic growth, particularly in developing and developed nations.\n\nThe presented generalized framework offers a solid basis for effective road route planning and optimization by combining deep learning and MCDM techniques. Its comprehensive and adaptable structure suits diverse contexts and project needs. The iterative weight assignment within the MCDM phase allows the exploration of different scenarios and prioritization of various criteria, leading to informed decision-making. The emphasis on deep learning for land use classification and GIS-based spatial analysis highlights the framework\u2019s capability for accurate and efficient route optimization. However, it\u2019s important to be aware that the framework\u2019s success depends on the quality and lack of bias within input datasets. Computational intensity should be a consideration. Overall, this generalized framework serves as a valuable starting point, with the potential for continuous refinement to address the challenges of sustainable transportation and infrastructure development.\n\nThe outlined sustainability criteria emphasize the multifaceted nature of sustainable road construction. Prioritizing construction on stable, less sensitive lands underscores the need to rehabilitate existing infrastructure before expanding into pristine ecosystems, thus minimizing habitat destruction. Life-cycle assessments (LCA) may help in informed decision-making about materials and techniques that minimize environmental impacts. Community engagement plays a vital role; incorporating community voices in the planning process helps mitigate social disruptions and ensures projects address local concerns. Government agencies face the complex task of balancing these sustainability considerations with the need for transportation infrastructure development. Finding this balance often necessitates careful assessments of the economic benefits of new roads against their potential environmental and social costs. By considering sustainability in all phases of road construction, we can create a transportation system that minimizes environmental harm, supports economic health, and prioritizes the well-being of communities.\n\nThe field of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification has seen an evolution in techniques. Initially, traditional methods like Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees were used, but these face limitations when handling large datasets or complex patterns. Deep Learning\n# IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\n(DL) has come to dominate the field due to its ability to process vast amounts of data and uncover intricate patterns, which translates into higher accuracy in classifying land features. Techniques like Deep Belief Networks, Generative Adversarial, Stacked Autoencoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks are all being explored for LULC applications. The quality of the dataset plays a significant role in DL success; this means selecting appropriate data sources and rigorously prepping input through noise reduction and preprocessing. LULC classification finds valuable applications across sectors. It can be used in urban planning, resource management, and sustainable development but also extends to fields like oil and gas pipeline routing. LULC analysis can serve as a crucial backbone for many linear engineering applications, helping classify land cover types to support informed decision-making about infrastructure development and minimize environmental impact.\n\nThe integration of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provides a powerful method for selecting optimal road and highway alignments. These methods offer a structured approach to handle complexities, carefully balancing factors like environmental impact, economic cost, social concerns, and technical feasibility. MCDM is ideal for this application as it allows for the consideration of multiple, often conflicting criteria, incorporates expert judgment and stakeholder input, and increases transparency in the decision-making process. Selecting the most relevant criteria, assigning appropriate weights, and choosing the right MCDM techniques (such as TOPSIS, AHP, VIKOR, ELECTRE, Grey Theory, and PROMETHEE) are crucial for successful outcomes. By carefully utilizing these strategies, MCDM and GIS enable well-informed and sustainable road alignment choices.\n\nChoosing the most suitable algorithm for optimal road generation depends on several factors, including the prioritization for the road (shortest distance, minimizing construction costs, environmental impact reduction, etc.), the data format available (grid-based maps, linear maps, etc.), and the trade-off between finding the absolute best solution and obtaining a solution quickly. For guaranteeing the absolute shortest path, Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm is the reliable choice, especially when negative edge weights aren\u2019t present. A* can be faster, particularly with a well-designed heuristic, and also handles negative edge weights. When road network planning problems become complex for traditional methods to efficiently navigate vast solution spaces, genetic algorithms provide a powerful alternative. These nature-inspired algorithms excel at searching these complex landscapes and identifying high-quality solutions. The D\u2019Esopo-Pape algorithm often proves very efficient for road generation and addresses negative edge weights; however, it\u2019s crucial to be aware of its potential for exponential time complexity in rare worst-case graph structures. The ideal choice ultimately depends on the problem\u2019s constraints, the type of optimization desired, the data format, and the relative importance of guaranteed optimality versus computational speed. Investigating hybrid approaches and emerging optimization techniques could further improve road generation solutions in the future.\n\n# V. FUTURE SCOPE AND RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\n\nThe findings of this systematic literature review illuminate several pathways for future research and development in the field of road route optimization using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), deep learning, and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques. These pathways not only address the existing gaps identified in the current body of literature but also aim to leverage the rapid advancements in technology and computational methods. The future scope of this research domain can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. Integration of Emerging Technologies: Future studies should explore the integration of newer geospatial technologies and emerging deep learning models into the road route optimization process. This includes the application of cutting-edge AI techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Reinforcement Learning in the context of GIS for more accurate and dynamic route planning.\n2. Enhanced MCDM Approaches: There is a clear need for the development of more sophisticated MCDM frameworks that can handle the complexities and multi-faceted nature of road route optimization. Future research should focus on creating more nuanced MCDM models that incorporate a wider range of criteria, including climate change impacts, social equity, and future urban growth patterns.\n3. Cross-Disciplinary Approaches: Combine insights from urban planning, environmental science, social sciences, and computer science can lead to more holistic and sustainable road route optimization methodologies. This could involve developing new collaborative frameworks that allow for the incorporation of diverse perspectives and expertise.\n4. Data Availability and Quality: There remains a significant challenge in the availability and quality of geospatial data required for road route optimization. Future research should address these challenges by developing new methods for data collection, processing, and sharing, particularly in regions where data are scarce or of poor quality.\n5. Case Studies and Real-world Applications: To validate and refine the proposed methodologies, there is a need for more comprehensive case studies and real-world applications. Future studies should apply the developed frameworks to actual road planning projects, providing insights into their practicality, effectiveness, and areas for improvement.\n6. Sustainability and Resilience: Future research should place a greater emphasis on sustainability and resilience in road route planning. This includes studying the long-term impacts of road infrastructure on ecosystems, communities, and climate change, and developing routes that are not only optimized for current conditions but also adaptable to future changes.\n7. Global and Regional Studies: Given the varying geographical, environmental, and socio-economic conditions across the globe, there is a need for more studies that fo-\n# IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\ncus on specific regions or compare different geographical contexts. This will help to develop more localized solutions and understand how global trends are manifested at the regional level. By addressing these areas, future research can significantly contribute to the development of more efficient, sustainable, and equitable road route optimization strategies, ultimately leading to better infrastructure planning and development worldwide.\n\n# VI. CONCLUSION\n\nThis systematic literature review provides a comprehensive synthesis of research focused on optimizing road route alignment. It highlights the powerful potential of integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS), deep learning, and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques for tackling complex challenges associated with sustainable road design development. The findings emphasize the importance of considering environmental, social, economic and engineering factors to align road projects with broader sustainable development goals.\n\nOur in-depth examination of 157 papers using the PRISMA methodology reveals that while researchers have extensively explored various algorithms and performance metrics, a truly end-to-end framework is still needed. We identified a reliance on commercial software for tasks like Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification as a potential barrier to comparative analysis. Additionally, the lack of specificity regarding optimization algorithms used in commercial software hinders a clear assessment of optimization levels.\n\nTo address these issues, we propose a generalized framework designed to streamline road route optimization. The framework outlines a systematic approach encompassing problem definition, criteria selection, data preparation, deep learning-based LULC classification, MCDM, and least-cost path analysis. This structured framework serves as a foundation for future research and real-world implementation.\n\nThis study makes several key contributions to the field. Firstly, by thoroughly analyzing existing literature, it offers a comprehensive, statistically-backed overview of the current state of the field. This includes revealing trends in research focus, geographical distribution of studies, and the evolution of methodologies. Secondly, the study demonstrates the efficiency of deep learning in significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, a crucial step in identifying and evaluating potential road routes. Thirdly, it showcases the increasing adoption of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques for a more holistic approach to road alignment, incorporating diverse environmental, economic, and social factors. Lastly, by highlighting the potential for further integration of deep learning and GIS methods, the study pinpoints an exciting, underexplored avenue within the field.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\n1.

This systematic literature review aims to identify existing research trends, methodologies, research gaps and propose a generalized framework for streamlining the road route optimization process. The review addresses three key research questions: RQ-1. The application of deep learning for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, RQ-2. The use of MCDM techniques in road route alignment and RQ-3. Techniques for optimizing road route alignment. Utilizing PRISMA, we assessed 370 papers, selected 132 through full-text evaluation, and added 25 via snowball sampling, totaling 157 records for analysis. The results reveal trends in current research, geographical distribution and the evolution of methodologies. It is found that Deep learning techniques significantly improve LULC classification accuracy, while MCDM techniques enable a holistic approach to road route alignment by incorporating diverse factors. The proposed generalized framework outlines a systematic approach encompassing problem definition, criteria selection, data preparation, deep learning-based LULC classification, MCDM and Least Cost Path analysis. This SLR contributes to the development of efficient, sustainable and equitable road route optimization strategies for better infrastructure planning and worldwide development. There is scope for integrating emerging technologies, enhancing MCDM approaches, promoting cross-disciplinary collaboration, addressing data availability and quality, conducting case studies, emphasizing sustainability, resilience and focusing on global and regional contexts.\n\nIndex Terms\u2014Road Route Alignment and Optimization, Land Use Land Cover (LULC) Classification, Deep Learning (DL), Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), and AI Searching Techniques.\n\n# I. INTRODUCTION\n\nGEOGRAPHIC Information System (GIS) has become an essential tool in modern geoinformatics and geo-planning. Their integration with advanced technologies like AI and deep learning is revolutionizing how we approach complex challenges such as road alignment and linear infrastructure development. Traditionally, road construction relied heavily on manual surveys and measurements. This approach, while effective in its time, often neglected critical factors such as environmental, economic, engineering and social considerations.\n\nShitij Agrawal, Sanskar Jamadar and Suraj Sawant are with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, COEP Technological University, Pune (411005), Maharashtra, India (e-mail: agrawalss21.comp@coeptech.ac.in; jamadarsr21.comp@coeptech.ac.in; sts.comp@coeptech.ac.in).\n\nRahul Dev Garg is with the Civil Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee, Uttrakhand, India (e-mail: rdgarg@ce.iitr.ac.in).\n\nIn today\u2019s world, where road networks are continuously expanding to support growth and meet sustainable development goals, there\u2019s an increasing need for AI-driven road route optimization. This approach leverages the power of GIS combined with the analytical capabilities of deep learning to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of road development projects.\n\nRoads are the backbone of transportation infrastructure, playing a vital role in connecting communities, facilitating trade, and driving economic growth (1). Recognizing the importance of roads, governments worldwide invest heavily in road construction and maintenance (2). In the United States, the Biden administration has put forward a proposal for a $2 trillion infrastructure initiative aimed at considerable enhancements to the nation\u2019s infrastructure, including major investments in roads, bridges, and highways (3). Similarly, India has ambitious plans to expand its road network, with the government aiming to construct 65,000 km of national highways by 2022. This project is expected to incur a cost of Rs. 5.35 lakh crore (approximately US$ 741.51 billion) (4). These investments not only improve connectivity and reduce travel times but also create employment opportunities (5). However, the development of road infrastructure must also consider sustainability and environmental concerns, such as greenhouse gas emissions and habitat loss (6).\n\nFailure to integrate GIS with deep learning in this domain can lead to persistent delays, inefficiency, violations of pre-set constraints and suboptimal routing decisions. Given the high demand for sustainable road development, addressing these challenges is more urgent than ever.\n\nMoreover, the methodologies and frameworks developed for optimizing road routes using GIS and deep learning can be applied to other linear engineering problems such as railway route alignment, selection for oil and gas pipelines, metro route selection, and evacuation route selection. This review aims to develop a comprehensive framework for road route optimization, leveraging the combined strengths of GIS, deep learning and optimization to address the complex demands of modern infrastructure development. This approach is not only about improving road construction but is also a step towards more intelligent, efficient and sustainable infrastructure planning and development. The 2023 study by F. Jiang et al. presents a comprehensive framework for sustainable urban road alignment planning, focusing on the identification and evaluation of key factors (7). This study categorizes factors into demands such as traffic and local development and constraints including environmental, engineering, cost and social aspects. The framework employs",

This section aims to give an overview of the process, further sections describe individual components of the process in detail. This involves a threefold approach:\n\n1. Defining the endpoints and the problem at hand, specifically focusing on the source and destination between which the road needs to be built.\n2. Identifying the criteria to consider such as environmental, social, economic and engineering factors which are crucial in road construction. These criteria may vary based on the study\u2019s nature and should be referenced from existing literature.\n3. Preparing and collecting the dataset relevant to the defined criteria, which may involve downloading geospatial datasets for the area under consideration. The dataset should include classes related to the defined criteria to create an overlay map.\n4. Preprocessing the data to ensure consistency in format and resolution and to eliminate issues such as clouds and shadows for better classification. This involves converting vector data to raster format for ease of processing, considering that raster data structures allow for a more analytical approach in continuous space study, despite their disadvantages in accuracy and data storage.\n5. Performing LULC classification using various deep learning techniques for image segmentation. The classes used for segmentation depend on the initially defined criteria.\n6. Identifying and assigning ranks to the criteria, which could be derived from literature or determined by field experts. These ranks are crucial for the application of the algorithms to derive optimal alignments.",

Applying MCDM techniques to identify the weights of the criteria based on the ranks provided by the field experts. These weights are crucial for the subsequent steps of the framework.\n2. Apply the assigned weights to the raster data, creating a weighted raster that represents all the criteria. This step combines the LULC classification results with the criteria weights, preparing the data for the least cost path analysis (LCPA).\n3. Perform least cost path analysis (LCPA) on the weighted raster to find the optimal route between source and destination.\n4. Generate multiple candidate routes by varying the criteria weights in the LCPA step. This will provide a set of potential routes that optimize different aspects of the problem.\n5. Apply MCDM techniques to evaluate routes based on the predefined criteria. This step provides a comprehensive evaluation of the generated routes from multiple perspectives.\n6. Conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the MCDM results by varying the criteria weights and observing how the rankings of the candidate routes change. If the rankings remain relatively stable, it indicates that the results are robust and less sensitive to changes in the criteria weights.\n7.

Experts use Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods to assess the importance of each factor. Furthermore, the study introduces a least-cost wide path analysis for road alignment which considers road width and accommodates both new road construction and the expansion of existing roads.\n\nIn a related domain, the 2023 review paper by Fei Li et al. proposes integrating remote sensing with machine learning techniques to enhance urban sustainability (8). This integration aims to make urban sustainability more explicable and efficient. While the literature review by F. Jiang et al. contributes significantly to the field, it also opens avenues for future research, particularly in integrating AI technologies like deep learning and further exploring MCDM techniques (7). Similarly, the work of Fei Li et al. highlights the potential of combining machine learning with remote sensing to address urban sustainability challenges (8).\n\nThe existing literature on route alignment primarily discusses various factors involved in developing new routes and the methodologies for route selection. However, with the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, especially in deep learning, there emerges a need to explore the role of deep learning in route alignment. Additionally, while Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques play a crucial role in the road route alignment process, there is a noticeable lack of comprehensive literature analyzing MCDM techniques specifically for road route alignment. This situation highlights a significant research gap that needs to be filled, underscoring the importance of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR).\n\nThis review stands out by uniquely integrating road route alignment with deep learning techniques and analyzing Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, complemented by the latest research trends. This approach distinguishes it from other studies in road route planning.\n\nThis research revolves around three pivotal research questions, enhanced by insights from a systematic review employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology (9).\n\nFirstly, the research investigates how deep learning, a type of advanced technology in artificial intelligence, is used to study Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Classification. Deep learning is good at understanding complex data and it can be helpful in identifying different types of land and how they are used.\n\nSecondly, it looks at Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques. MCDM helps in making good decisions about where to place roads by considering many different factors. This study explores how MCDM is used in practice.\n\nFinally, the SLR examines techniques for optimizing road route alignment. Through the exploration of these three areas, the research seeks to offer comprehensive and current insight into the planning of road routes and the examination of land use in an intelligent and well-informed manner. This SLR includes insights from general observations of paper distributions, application fields, deep learning and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approaches, along with road route optimization methods.\n\n# METHODOLOGY\n\nThis study sets out to develop a comprehensive framework for the integration of deep learning in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) analysis for optimizing road route alignment, utilizing Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques. This framework aims to enhance road route alignment projects by promoting sustainability. To achieve this, a systematic literature review was performed using the PRISMA method, a well-acknowledged approach for structuring systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This systematic review enables an in-depth and broad understanding of the current research that merges deep learning with LULC and examines MCDM and road route optimization techniques. It identifies the existing state of knowledge, the methods employed and the potential research gaps that could be filled in future studies. The application of the PRISMA method guarantees that the review process is both reproducible and transparent, thereby reinforcing the study\u2019s reliability and facilitating the verification and future update of its conclusions with new findings.

While ELECTRE I and II focus on the use of concordance and discordance matrices, ELECTRE III introduces the principle of fuzzy logic, utilizing preference and indifference thresholds to determine concordance and discordance indexes. The steps for The ELECTRE I Method are as follows:\n\n1. Step 1: The criteria are coded on numerical scales with identical ranges to allow for comparison. This step is not always simple and may require a common scale to be constructed. The coding should justify the use of the max operator introduced later to model discordance.\n2. Step 2: For each pair of actions (a, b) in the set A, where a \u2260 b, compute the concordance index using equation 28:\n\nc(aSb) = \u2211{j:g(a)g(b)}j wj\n3. Step 3: For each pair of actions (a, b) in the set A, where a \u2260 b, compute the discordance index using equation 29:\n\nd(aSb) = {j: gj(maxj(b))} {gj(b) \u2212 gj(a)}a < g\n4. Step 4: An action \"a outranks b\" (aSb) if and only if:\n\n1. The concordance index c(aSb) is greater than or equal to a given concordance level s, where s is typically in the range [0.5, 1 \u2212 minj\u2208J wj].\n2. The discordance index d(aSb) is less than or equal to a given discordance level v.\n5. Step 5: Exploitation of the outranking relation, Identify a subset of actions (kernel) from which the decision-maker can select the final action. Actions outside the kernel are outranked by at least one action in the kernel. If the graph contains no direct cycles, there exists a single kernel forming a partition on A. If the graph contains direct cycles, a preprocessing step is needed to reduce maximal direct cycles to singleton components, forming a partition on A.\n\n# 6) PROMETHEE:\n\nThe PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations) method is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that was developed by Brans and Vincke (1985) (73). Different versions of PROMETHEE were introduced (Brans & Mareschal, 1991 (74), 1994 (75), 1995 (76)). PROMETHEE evaluates various alternatives based on multiple criteria. It is distinguished by its use of preference functions to translate deviations between alternatives into preference degrees, facilitating a comprehensive and nuanced comparison of alternatives. The steps of the PROMETHEE Method are as follows:\n\n1. Step 1: Determination of Preference Functions, The process begins by determining a specific preference function Pj(a, b) for each criterion j. This function translates the deviation between the evaluations of two alternatives a and b into a preference degree ranging from 0 to 1, based on the equation provided by (77), the equation is as follows:\n\nPj(a, b) = Gj{fj(a) \u2212 fj(b)} (31)\n2. Step 2: Assignment of Weights to Criteria, Relative importance or weights of each criterion are assigned to reflect their significance in the decision-making process.\n3. Step 3: Computation of Overall Preference Index, An overall preference index \u03c0(a, b) is computed by taking into account all criteria. This index is based on the equations:\n\n\u03c0(a, b) = \u2211j Wj Pj(a, b) (32)\n4. Step 4: involves the Calculation of Positive and Negative Preference Flows. The positive preference flow, denoted as \u03c6+(a) measures the extent to which an alternative a is globally preferred over all other alternatives. Conversely, the negative preference flow, \u03c6\u2212(a) assesses the degree to which an alternative a is globally preferred by all other alternatives.\n5. Step 5: involves determining Partial and Complete Rankings. The PROMETHEE I method achieves a partial ranking by intersecting two distinct rankings: the first is created by arranging actions based on their positive flow scores in a descending order, and the second is formed by organizing actions according to their negative flow scores in an ascending order. An optimal action is characterized by having a positive preference flow of 1 and a negative preference flow of 0.\n6. Step 6: Selection of the Best Alternative, The best alternative is selected based on the comprehensive evaluation of positive and negative preference flows, taking into account the relative importance of each criterion.",

Remote sensing along with least cost path analysis (LCPA) is a proven tool for optimal route selection (80). Least-cost path analysis (LCPA) based on shortest path algorithms is usually employed to find optimal road route alignment in the raster data in the GIS environment (Douglas 1994) (81). LCPA provides routes according to the desired parameter-oriented approach (78). LCP algorithm is used to find the least cost between two locations, where the least cost path would be minimum distance or minimum construction cost depending on the user (22; 82).

Rybansky proposed an approach that combines Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi graphs, and Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm to determine the quickest or shortest paths, considering factors like tree stand structure, vehicle dimensions, and terrain constraints to effectively map out optimal routes for emergency scenarios (85). A study by Manoj K. Jha et al. adapts previous highway optimization strategies for rail transit, utilizing GIS for evaluating costs and environmental impacts (86).\n\nAccording to the research conducted by Ju Young Kang et al., Dijkstra algorithm is more useful when we are dealing with the GIS raster maps as compared to the A* algorithm, as A* cannot guarantee finding the shortest path. Unlike video games or autonomous vehicles, real-time search is not important while optimum solution is a key requirement (81). However, according to research conducted by Marcelo Otone Aguiar et al., D\u2019Esopo-Pape is more efficient than algorithms like Dijkstra, and Bellman-Ford (88).\n\n# Following are some of the most popular cost optimization algorithms according to the literature:\n\n- Algorithm 1 Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm (89)\n\nfunction DIJKSTRA(g, s)\nfor each vertex y in g do\ndist[y] \u2190 \u221e\nprevious[y] \u2190 undefined\nend for\ndist[s] \u2190 0\nN \u2190 the set of all nodes in Graph\nwhile N is not empty do\nx \u2190 node in N with smallest dist[]\nremove x from N\nfor each neighbor y of x do\nalt \u2190 dist[x] + dist between(x, y)\nif alt < dist[y] then\ndist[y] \u2190 alt\nprevious[y] \u2190 x\nend if\nend for\nend while\nreturn previous[]\n\n# Fig. 20.

The research utilizes the PRISMA method which is highly respected for its systematic and structured approach which enhances the credibility and trustworthiness of the review. The use of multiple major databases and the \u2019backward snowballing\u2019 technique increases the chance of finding the most relevant research available. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Clearly defined filters ensure including research that genuinely aligns with research aims, maintaining the focus defined in Table 3.\n\nThe research questions mentioned in Table 1 are crisp, unambiguous and unique which are not being considered in any other research paper and these questions are essential to understand road route optimization, deep learning techniques for LULC and application of MCDM techniques.\n\nThe analysis of publication trends highlights intriguing dynamics within the field of road route alignment optimization research. The steady increase in publications on road route alignment, with a dip in 2022, suggests a maintained interest in this domain. Notably, the growth of publications related to LULC using deep learning in 2023 reveals a promising trajectory for incorporating advanced computational techniques also there is an influence of increasing computational power, making DL more feasible. This surge could be due to the increased accuracy and efficiency that deep learning offers in analyzing complex land cover datasets. Conversely, the decline in articles focused on MCDM techniques from 2020 onwards warrants further investigation. It\u2019s possible that the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s disruptions to fieldwork and data collection may have contributed to this decrease. Additionally, researchers might be re-evaluating MCDM techniques in light of new challenges posed by the pandemic, such as the rise of e-commerce and potential changes in traffic patterns. Alternatively, there could be a shift towards integrating MCDM with deep learning methods or exploring other optimization techniques altogether which are better suited to the increased computational resources now available.\n\nThe higher number of articles originating from India, China, Turkey, and the USA reflects a correlation between infrastructure development priorities and research output. This aligns with the importance of road networks as a core component of transportation systems, which are vital for economic growth, particularly in developing and developed nations.\n\nThe presented generalized framework offers a solid basis for effective road route planning and optimization by combining deep learning and MCDM techniques. Its comprehensive and adaptable structure suits diverse contexts and project needs. The iterative weight assignment within the MCDM phase allows the exploration of different scenarios and prioritization of various criteria, leading to informed decision-making. The emphasis on deep learning for land use classification and GIS-based spatial analysis highlights the framework\u2019s capability for accurate and efficient route optimization. However, it\u2019s important to be aware that the framework\u2019s success depends on the quality and lack of bias within input datasets. Computational intensity should be a consideration. Overall, this generalized framework serves as a valuable starting point, with the potential for continuous refinement to address the challenges of sustainable transportation and infrastructure development.\n\nThe outlined sustainability criteria emphasize the multifaceted nature of sustainable road construction. Prioritizing construction on stable, less sensitive lands underscores the need to rehabilitate existing infrastructure before expanding into pristine ecosystems, thus minimizing habitat destruction. Life-cycle assessments (LCA) may help in informed decision-making about materials and techniques that minimize environmental impacts. Community engagement plays a vital role; incorporating community voices in the planning process helps mitigate social disruptions and ensures projects address local concerns. Government agencies face the complex task of balancing these sustainability considerations with the need for transportation infrastructure development. Finding this balance often necessitates careful assessments of the economic benefits of new roads against their potential environmental and social costs. By considering sustainability in all phases of road construction, we can create a transportation system that minimizes environmental harm, supports economic health, and prioritizes the well-being of communities.\n\nThe field of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification has seen an evolution in techniques. Initially, traditional methods like Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees were used, but these face limitations when handling large datasets or complex patterns.

          "text": "# IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS\n\n(DL) has come to dominate the field due to its ability to process vast amounts of data and uncover intricate patterns, which translates into higher accuracy in classifying land features. Techniques like Deep Belief Networks, Generative Adversarial, Stacked Autoencoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks are all being explored for LULC applications. The quality of the dataset plays a significant role in DL success; this means selecting appropriate data sources and rigorously prepping input through noise reduction and preprocessing. LULC classification finds valuable applications across sectors. It can be used in urban planning, resource management, and sustainable development but also extends to fields like oil and gas pipeline routing. LULC analysis can serve as a crucial backbone for many linear engineering applications, helping classify land cover types to support informed decision-making about infrastructure development and minimize environmental impact.\n\nThe integration of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provides a powerful method for selecting optimal road and highway alignments. These methods offer a structured approach to handle complexities, carefully balancing factors like environmental impact, economic cost, social concerns, and technical feasibility. MCDM is ideal for this application as it allows for the consideration of multiple, often conflicting criteria, incorporates expert judgment and stakeholder input, and increases transparency in the decision-making process. Selecting the most relevant criteria, assigning appropriate weights, and choosing the right MCDM techniques (such as TOPSIS, AHP, VIKOR, ELECTRE, Grey Theory, and PROMETHEE) are crucial for successful outcomes. By carefully utilizing these strategies, MCDM and GIS enable well-informed and sustainable road alignment choices.\n\nChoosing the most suitable algorithm for optimal road generation depends on several factors, including the prioritization for the road (shortest distance, minimizing construction costs, environmental impact reduction, etc.), the data format available (grid-based maps, linear maps, etc.), and the trade-off between finding the absolute best solution and obtaining a solution quickly. For guaranteeing the absolute shortest path, Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm is the reliable choice, especially when negative edge weights aren\u2019t present. A* can be faster, particularly with a well-designed heuristic, and also handles negative edge weights. When road network planning problems become complex for traditional methods to efficiently navigate vast solution spaces, genetic algorithms provide a powerful alternative. These nature-inspired algorithms excel at searching these complex landscapes and identifying high-quality solutions. The D\u2019Esopo-Pape algorithm often proves very efficient for road generation and addresses negative edge weights; however, it\u2019s crucial to be aware of its potential for exponential time complexity in rare worst-case graph structures. The ideal choice ultimately depends on the problem\u2019s constraints, the type of optimization desired, the data format, and the relative importance of guaranteed optimality versus computational speed. Investigating hybrid approaches and emerging optimization techniques could further improve road generation solutions in the future.\n\n# V. FUTURE SCOPE AND RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\n\nThe findings of this systematic literature review illuminate several pathways for future research and development in the field of road route optimization using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), deep learning, and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques. These pathways not only address the existing gaps identified in the current body of literature but also aim to leverage the rapid advancements in technology and computational methods. The future scope of this research domain can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. Integration of Emerging Technologies: Future studies should explore the integration of newer geospatial technologies and emerging deep learning models into the road route optimization process. This includes the application of cutting-edge AI techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Reinforcement Learning in the context of GIS for more accurate and dynamic route planning.\n2. Enhanced MCDM Approaches: There is a clear need for the development of more sophisticated MCDM frameworks that can handle the complexities and multi-faceted nature of road route optimization. Future research should focus on creating more nuanced MCDM models that incorporate a wider range of criteria, including climate change impacts, social equity, and future urban growth patterns.\n3. Cross-Disciplinary Approaches: Combine insights from urban planning, environmental science, social sciences, and computer science can lead to more holistic and sustainable road route optimization methodologies. This could involve developing new collaborative frameworks that allow for the incorporation of diverse perspectives and expertise.\n4. Data Availability and Quality: There remains a significant challenge in the availability and quality of geospatial data required for road route optimization. Future research should address these challenges by developing new methods for data collection, processing, and sharing, particularly in regions where data are scarce or of poor quality.\n5. Case Studies and Real-world Applications: To validate and refine the proposed methodologies, there is a need for more comprehensive case studies and real-world applications. Future studies should apply the developed frameworks to actual road planning projects, providing insights into their practicality, effectiveness, and areas for improvement.\n6. Sustainability and Resilience: Future research should place a greater emphasis on sustainability and resilience in road route planning. This includes studying the long-term impacts of road infrastructure on ecosystems, communities, and climate change, and developing routes that are not only optimized for current conditions but also adaptable to future changes.\n7. Global and Regional Studies: Given the varying geographical, environmental, and socio-economic conditions across the globe, there is a need for more studies that fo-",

This will help to develop more localized solutions and understand how global trends are manifested at the regional level. By addressing these areas, future research can significantly contribute to the development of more efficient, sustainable, and equitable road route optimization strategies, ultimately leading to better infrastructure planning and development worldwide.\n\n# VI. CONCLUSION\n\nThis systematic literature review provides a comprehensive synthesis of research focused on optimizing road route alignment. It highlights the powerful potential of integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS), deep learning, and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques for tackling complex challenges associated with sustainable road design development. The findings emphasize the importance of considering environmental, social, economic and engineering factors to align road projects with broader sustainable development goals.\n\nOur in-depth examination of 157 papers using the PRISMA methodology reveals that while researchers have extensively explored various algorithms and performance metrics, a truly end-to-end framework is still needed. We identified a reliance on commercial software for tasks like Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification as a potential barrier to comparative analysis. Additionally, the lack of specificity regarding optimization algorithms used in commercial software hinders a clear assessment of optimization levels.\n\nTo address these issues, we propose a generalized framework designed to streamline road route optimization. The framework outlines a systematic approach encompassing problem definition, criteria selection, data preparation, deep learning-based LULC classification, MCDM, and least-cost path analysis. This structured framework serves as a foundation for future research and real-world implementation.\n\nThis study makes several key contributions to the field. Firstly, by thoroughly analyzing existing literature, it offers a comprehensive, statistically-backed overview of the current state of the field. This includes revealing trends in research focus, geographical distribution of studies, and the evolution of methodologies. Secondly, the study demonstrates the efficiency of deep learning in significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, a crucial step in identifying and evaluating potential road routes. Thirdly, it showcases the increasing adoption of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques for a more holistic approach to road alignment, incorporating diverse environmental, economic, and social factors. Lastly, by highlighting the potential for further integration of deep learning and GIS methods, the study pinpoints an exciting, underexplored avenue within the field.\n\n# REFERENCES\n\n1.
